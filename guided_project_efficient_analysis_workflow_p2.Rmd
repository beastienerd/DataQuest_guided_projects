The book company I'm working for launched a new program encouraging customers to buy more books on July 1st, 2019, and it wants to know if this new program was successful at increasing sales and improving review quality. 
This guided project will focus on using the packages `purrr` and `stringr`.

Data Exploration:
How big is the dataset? What are the column names and what do they represent?
What are the data types of each of the columns?
Do any of the columns have missing data? If so, make a note of this.
