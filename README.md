# Introduction

Hi, this is a repository that will contain my guided projects from DataQuest. 
Currently, I am working on their Data Analyst in R career path.  

While I am in between jobs, and actively applying, I am working on my data analytics skills.
I used R when I was in college and recently got back to it (6 years later). 
I was using a different software called JMP in the medical device manufacturing industry.
